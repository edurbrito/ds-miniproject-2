### Instructions (Tested in Linux)

Ensure you have Python installed.

Then, run the following command:

```
general-byzantine-problem.sh <N>
            N   number of processes (N > 0)
```

It will automatically create a virtual environment (`env` folder), if it does not exist, and install the requirements.
Finally it will start the algorithm by creating the N processes.
